A list of technologies that I have played with...

At some point I realized that I have looked at so much tech, that sometimes I don't even remember that I played with it. Thus, here an attempt to at least take some notes:

## July 2025

- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) - I explored running vLLM when I investigated Voxtral STT.
- [Voxtral STT](https://github.com/coezbek/voxtral-test) - A whisper competitor. Seems fast, but have to see the accuracy. Currently, no timestamps in the model. No realtime input streaming. 
- [Kyutai STT](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/delayed-streams-modeling) - Low-latency Streaming TTS/STT
- [modal.com](https://modal.com) - GPU hosting / IaaS
- [MiniCPM-o](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o/) - Multi-modal STT/TTS/Vision model
