A list of technologies that I have played with...

At some point I realized that I have looked at so much tech, that sometimes I don't even remember that I played with it. Thus, here an attempt to at least take some notes:

## September 2025

- [ClearML](https://clear.ml/) Another monitoring platform like Wandb.

## August 2025

- [Resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer) and [ECAPA-TDNN](https://github.com/TaoRuijie/ECAPA-TDNN) for assessing speaker similarity
- [WandB](https://wandb.ai/site/) for hosting model learning graphs
- [rv](https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv) - new Ruby version manager with the goal to replace rvm, bundler, etc. written in Rust. I contributed a number of patches: https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv/pull/61, https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv/pull/68

## July 2025

- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) - I explored running vLLM when I investigated Voxtral STT.
- [Voxtral STT](https://github.com/coezbek/voxtral-test) - A whisper competitor. Seems fast, but have to see the accuracy. Currently, no timestamps in the model. No realtime input streaming. 
- [Kyutai STT](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/delayed-streams-modeling) - Low-latency Streaming TTS/STT
- [modal.com](https://modal.com) - GPU hosting / IaaS
- [MiniCPM-o](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o/) - Multi-modal STT/TTS/Vision model
